Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program - Memory Game Project

### How to play

* Clicking on cards will turn them over so that you can see what matches with the other.
* Your task is to match all the cards successfully.
* You would have a timer to count how much time you took.
* If you won you would have a model tells you what was your time and how many moves you made.
* There is a button at the modal asks if you wanna play again.
